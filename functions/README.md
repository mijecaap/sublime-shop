### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/functions.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd functions`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Install Firebase CLI tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

## Scripts

### `npm run serve`
Starts the Firebase emulators to locally test the functions.

### `npm run shell`

### `npm start`
Shortcut for `npm run shell` to initiate the interactive testing environment.

### `npm run deploy`
Deploys the functions to your Firebase project.

### `npm run logs`
Displays logs from the deployed functions for debugging purposes.
